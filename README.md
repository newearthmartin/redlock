## RedLock - Distributed locks with Redis and Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/glasslion/redlock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/glasslion/redlock)

This library implements the RedLock algorithm introduced by [@antirez](http://antirez.com/)


### Yet another ...
There are already a few redis based lock implementations in the Python world, e.g.  [retools](https://github.com/bbangert/retools),  [redis-lock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis-lock/0.2.0).

However, these libraries can only work with *single-master* redis server. When the Redis master goes down, your application has to face a single point of failure. We can't rely on the master-slave replication, because Redis replication is asynchronous.

> This is an obvious race condition with the master-slave replication model :
>  1. Client A acquires the lock into the master.
>  2. The master crashes before the write to the key is transmitted to the slave.
>  3. The slave gets promoted to master.
>  4. Client B acquires the lock to the same resource A already holds a lock for. SAFETY VIOLATION!

### A quick introduction to the RedLock algorithm
To resolve this problem, the Redlock algorithm assume we have `N` Redis masters. These nodes are totally independent (no replications). In order to acquire the lock, the client will try to acquire the lock in all the N instances sequentially. If and only if the client was able to acquire the lock in the majority (`(N+1)/2`)of the instances, the lock is considered to be acquired.

The detailed description of the RedLock algorithm can be found in the Redis documentation: [Distributed locks with Redis](http://redis.io/topics/distlock).

### Installation

```
pip install redlock
```

### APIs

The `redlock.RedLock` class shares a similar API with the `threading.Lock` class in the  Python Standard Library.
#### Basic Usage

```python
from redlock.lock import RedLock
# By default, if no redis connection details are
# provided, RedLock uses redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
lock =  RedLock("distributed_lock")
lock.acquire()
do_something()
lock.release()
```

#### With Statement / Context Manager

As with `threading.Lock`, `redlock.RedLock` objects are context managers thus support the [With Statement](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers). This way is more pythonic and recommended.

```python
from redlock.lock import RedLock
with RedLock("distributed_lock"):
    do_something()
```

#### Specify multiple Redis nodes

```python
from redlock.lock import RedLock
with RedLock("distributed_lock",
              connection_details=[
                {'host': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', 'port': 6379, 'db': 0},
                {'host': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', 'port': 6379, 'db': 0},
                {'host': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', 'port': 6379, 'db': 0},
                {'host': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', 'port': 6379, 'db': 0},
              ]
            ):
    do_something()
```

The `connection_details` parameter expects a list of keyword arguments for initializing Redis clients.
Other acceptable Redis client arguments  can be found on the [redis-py doc](http://redis-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#redis.StrictRedis).

#### Reuse Redis clients with the RedLockFactory

Usually the connection details of the Redis nodes are fixed. `RedLockFactory` can help reuse them, create multiple RedLocks but only initialize the clients once.

```python
from redlock.lock import RedLockFactory
factory = RedLockFactory(
    connection_details=[
        {'host': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'},
        {'host': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'},
        {'host': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'},
        {'host': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'},
    ])

with factory.create_lock("distributed_lock"):
    do_something()

with factory.create_lock("another_lock"):
    do_something()
```
